# preenfm3 doc

In this folder you can find a Quick Start doc : [pfm3_qs.pdf](https://github.com/Ixox/preenfm3/blob/master/doc/pfm3_qs.pdf)

But before you may need to build your preenfm3 and install the firmware before.  
The rest of the doc is available in this wiki:  
https://github.com/Ixox/preenfm3/wiki

There's also a forum to discuss any question you may have:  
http://ixox.fr/forum/index.php?board=8.0

I hope you'll have great time building and using your preenfm.

Best,

Xavier
